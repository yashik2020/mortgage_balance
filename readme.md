Mortgage balance dashboard

Is it worth it to buy a house/condo with the current interest rates?
If any time in the future you decide to sell the property, what selling price would mean you are in the green?

**THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL TOOL! USE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.**

The idea is to calculate and compare:

- The amount you are paying as interest
- The amount you are paying as costs and fees
- The amount you are saving by not paying rent
- The amount you will be losing by putting down payment
- The amount is accrued in the estate by paying off the loan principal

Bring all this together and you will have an idea on the economies of purchasing a house, specially if you are looking at it as an short to mid term investment.
